            <h3> System Integration Project -- OtterPlay </h3>
            <img src="photos/otterplay.png" alt="Mobile View of Project" height="250" width="200">
            <p><b>Basic Summary:</b></p>
            <p> For this project I was required to develop a system using virtual machines to host a functioning website 
                on a server, implement working authentication, create databases to store user information, and use RabbitMQ as a queuing system. The idea behind 
                the project was to create a positive environent for online gaming by helping users find and match with other users instead of randomly being matched 
                with toxic players. </p>
            <p><b>Lessons I learned:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li> The basic architecture of a system and each component </li>
                <li> Working more with manipulating API and storing fetched information in a Database </li>
                <li> More experience using JavaScript to write functions and forms in the front-end </li>
                <li> Using PHP to communciate between databases and the queuing system </li>
            </ul>

            <img src="photos/lunatechNASA.png" alt="NASA page of Project" height="250" width="450">
            <p><b>Basic Summary:</b></p>
            <p>I competed in a GirlHacks hackathon with a team and together we created a space themed website that
                shares an astronomy fact that updates each day as well as asteroids are orbiting Earth. The website 
                also includes mini-games where the user can send a professor or an astronaut into space. My team ended 
                up winning first place in the competition for this project. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Lessons I learned:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li> Working with API for the first time, fetching from the NASA API in order to get daily space facts and astroid information </li>
                <li> Organizing tasks quickly with Jira and communicating with my team in order to finish the project within the 24 hour time limit </li>
                <li> Improving my problem solving by recognizing a data source error that broke the code and implementing a solution </li>
            </ul>

            <h3> HackNJIT 2022 -- Marshmallow Toast Simulator </h3>

            <img src="photos/marshmallowScreen.png" alt="Game screen of Project" height="250" width="450">
            <p><b>Basic Summary:</b></p>
            <p>I competed in a HackNJIT hackathon with a team and together we created an interactive game with a Python extension, Pygame that
               prompts the player to try and roast a marshmallow. There are options to select different cooking durations, each duration being 
               a random number pulled from a set range. The player wins if their marshmallow is golden brown, and loses if it is burnt. My team ended 
                up winning "Best Camping Themed Hack" in the competition for this project. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Lessons I learned:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li> How to use Pygame for the first time within the 24 hour time limit in order to add screens, functionalities, and graphics </li>
                <li> How to integrate my team's Python script (for the math behind the duration functions) into the screens I was coding </li>
            </ul>
